# OPP_Ex01

Authors: Omar essa and Warda Essa Descreption: this project represent the classes monom and polynom, each class have its functions,constructors the class Monom represent the monom ax^b, a constructor that receves a,b as numbers and another one that gets them as a string there is also couple of functions that works on monom such as add sub mult.. the class Polynom is based on class Monom and it represent the poylnom ax1^b +cx2^d+... same as the monom class it also got constructors both receve numbers and string and couple of functions that works on polynom such as copy add mult area root... we used some webs as refernce: https://github.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F61aUno8qHk https://www.javatips.net/api/Assignments-master/Pascaru%20S.%20Cosmina%20Roxana/Polynomials%20Assignment%201/polynomials/src/polynomials/Monom.java https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/90188/a-simpler-multiply-and-addition-polynomial-function https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/code/Polynomial.java we also added a junit testers to our project and tested every function that needed to be tested in both monom and polynom class and both testers works perfectly
