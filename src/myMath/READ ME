we created both classes 
Monom ans Polynom with the help of internet library 
we read some info from
 https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/90188/a-simpler-multiply-and-addition-polynomial-function
 https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/code/Polynomial.java
 and also we used some of the dta and codes from gethub website
 creating both monom and polynom was similier and easy to some point the tricky part was to creat a monom or polynom that can receve a string and translate it to numbers
 plus multplying the numbers was also tricky
 at the end we made a test class to test all of our functions and when we run the test class, all worked fine and perfect
 there is some mistakes here and there but in general this ex is well done
 :-)
 have fun reading and checking our Ex...
